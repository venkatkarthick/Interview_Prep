# Dropbox

## üéØ Why Design Dropbox (Cloud Storage System)?

### ‚úÖ Real-World Motivation

* Users want **anywhere, anytime access** to files across devices.
* Cloud storage like Dropbox enables:

    * **Availability** (via internet)
    * **Durability** (no data loss)
    * **Scalability** (storage on-demand)

> üìå Think: Sync between devices, offline editing, version history, and shared access.

## üìã 1. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### üîß Functional

1. Upload/download files from any device
2. Share files/folders with other users
3. Automatic sync across devices
4. Handle **large files** (up to 1GB)
5. Support **offline editing** ‚Üí sync when online
6. **Versioning/Snapshotting** of files

### üß± Non-Functional

* Strong **ACID properties**
* **High reliability** (data loss not acceptable)
* **Low latency sync** and update detection
* **Efficient bandwidth usage**

| Category             | Details                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency**      | High read & write volume                           |
| **Sync granularity** | Use **chunks** (e.g. 4MB) instead of full files    |
| **Fault-tolerance**  | Retry only failed chunks                           |
| **Efficiency**       | Transfer only modified chunks (diff-based updates) |
| **Deduplication**    | Avoid uploading same content multiple times        |
| **Local cache**      | Store file metadata on the client for speed        |
| **Offline support**  | Maintain change log ‚Üí sync when online             |

> üìå Interview Tip: **Chunking + Metadata + Diff Uploads** = Key to scalable Dropbox.

## üìè 3. Capacity Estimation (Estimation Questions Are Common!)

| Metric                   | Assumption               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Total Users              | 500M                     |

## üß† What to Emphasize in an Interview

### üì¶ Storage

* Store files in **chunks**
* Maintain **versioned metadata**
* Use **hashing** (SHA-256 or similar) for deduplication

### üîÑ Sync

* Client watches file system ‚Üí logs changes
* Changes sent as **diffs or chunk updates**
* Use **timestamp/versioning** to resolve conflicts

### üõ†Ô∏è Fault Tolerance

* Replicate data across **data centers**
* Retry failed chunks
* Support **rollback/version restore**

### ‚ö° Performance

* **CDN for downloads**
* Background upload/download manager on clients
* Reduce write amplification by **only syncing changed data**

## üó£Ô∏è Sample Interview Response

> ‚ÄúDropbox is a cloud file storage system enabling cross-device sync and collaboration.
> Files are chunked for efficient storage and updates, with deduplication to save space.
> We maintain metadata separately, use versioning for snapshot recovery, and enable offline sync by queueing changes.
> The system needs to support strong consistency and be resilient to client-side failures, while scaling to handle millions of users and petabytes of data.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

Allow users to sync a workspace folder across devices with automatic upload, download, and change propagation. Changes on one device (create/update/delete) should reflect on all connected devices in near real-time.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Design

### üîß Core Requirement

* Users specify a **workspace folder**.
* Files placed/modified/deleted in this folder get **synced** to the cloud and across devices.
* Sync includes both **file content** and **metadata** (name, size, timestamp, sharing info).

### üß© Key Design Components

* **Clients**: Detect changes, sync content + metadata, and listen for updates.
* **Metadata Servers**: Store metadata (file info, versions, etc.) in a structured DB.
* **Block Storage**: Stores file content in **chunked** format.
* **Sync Service**: Manages versioning and propagates changes.
* **Message Queues**: Enables asynchronous and scalable communication.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Component Design

### a. üñ•Ô∏è Client

Monitors local workspace, syncs files/chunks, manages local metadata, and handles conflict resolution.

**Key Subcomponents:**

1. **Internal Metadata DB**: Local cache of file/chunk info for offline access.
2. **Chunker**: Splits files into 4MB chunks (optimizable), detects diffs using hashes.
3. **Watcher**: Monitors file system changes, listens to server notifications.
4. **Indexer**: Updates internal metadata, triggers upload/download via Sync Service.

**Key Considerations:**

* Use **chunking + hash-based diff** to save bandwidth.
* Store metadata locally for speed + offline support.
* Use **HTTP Long Polling** or **WebSockets** to get near real-time updates.
* **Exponential backoff** for retries on slow/unavailable servers.
* Mobile clients may sync only on demand to save battery/data.

---

### b. üóÉÔ∏è Metadata Database

Stores structured metadata about:

* Files and their versions
* Chunks and checksums
* Users
* Devices
* Workspaces (sync folders)

**DB Options:**

* **Relational DB (MySQL)**: Simpler consistency using built-in ACID.
* **NoSQL (DynamoDB, Cassandra)**: More scalable, but require app-level consistency logic.

---

### c. üîÅ Synchronization Service

Central logic hub for:

* Validating changes with metadata DB.
* Broadcasting changes to subscribed devices.
* Handling versioning and consistency.
* Running **differencing algorithms** to reduce data transfer.

**Optimization:**

* Transmit only changed chunks using hash comparison.
* Deduplicate chunks with identical hashes, even across users.

**Scaling Tip:**

* Use multiple Sync Service instances pulling from a **global request queue**.

---

### d. üì© Message Queue Service

Enables loose coupling and high throughput.

**Two Types of Queues:**

1. **Request Queue** (shared/global): Clients post changes here.
2. **Response Queues** (per-client): Sync Service posts updates to these.

Helps avoid polling overload and supports **push model** for updates.

---

### e. ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud/Block Storage

* Stores only file chunks (content).
* Clients interact **directly** with it.
* Decouples storage from metadata for flexibility and modular scaling.
